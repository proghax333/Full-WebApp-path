
## Phase 11 â€“ Generating and testing error codes

225. Generating normal error codes by visiting files that may not exist on the server - for example visit chintan.php or chintan.aspx file on any website
and it may redirect you to 404.php or 404.aspx or their customer error page. Check if an error page is generated by default web server or application
framework or a custom page is displayed which does not display any sensitive information.
226. Use BurpSuite fuzzing techniques to generate stack trace error codes - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDF6OkcvBzM
